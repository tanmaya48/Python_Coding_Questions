    You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different
    denominations and an integer `k`.
    
    You have an infinite number of coins of each denomination. However, you are
    **not allowed** to combine coins of different denominations.
    
    Return the `kth` **smallest** amount that can be made using these coins.
    
    **Constraints:**
    
      * `1 <= coins.length <= 15`
      * `1 <= coins[i] <= 25`
      * `1 <= k <= 2 * 10 ^ 9`
      * `coins` contains pairwise distinct integers.
