def maximumSumSubsequence(nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """
    You are given an array `nums` consisting of integers. You are also given a 2D
    array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [posi, xi]`.
    
    For query `i`, we first set `nums[posi]` equal to `xi`, then we calculate the
    answer to query `i` which is the **maximum** sum of a subsequence of `nums`
    where **no two adjacent elements are selected**.
    
    Return the sum of the answers to all queries.
    
    Since the final answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10 ^ 9 + 7`.
    
    A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by
    deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining
    elements.
    
    **Constraints:**
    
      * `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10 ^ 4`
      * `-10 ^ 5 <= nums[i] <= 10 ^ 5`
      * `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10 ^ 4`
      * `queries[i] == [posi, xi]`
      * `0 <= posi <= nums.length - 1`
      * `-10 ^ 5 <= xi <= 10 ^ 5`
