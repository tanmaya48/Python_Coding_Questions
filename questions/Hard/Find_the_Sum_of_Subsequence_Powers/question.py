    """
    You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, and a **positive**
    integer `k`.
    
    The **power** of a subsequence is defined as the **minimum** absolute
    difference between **any** two elements in the subsequence.
    
    Return the **sum** of **powers** of **all** subsequences of `nums` which
    have length **equal to** `k`.
    
    Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `10 ^ 9 + 7`.
    
    **Constraints:**
    
      * `2 <= n == nums.length <= 50`
      * `-10 ^ 8 <= nums[i] <= 10 ^ 8`
      * `2 <= k <= n`
