    You are given a array `points` representing integer coordinates of some points
    on a 2D plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.
    
    The distance between two points is defined as their Manhattan distance.
    
    Return the **minimum** possible value for **maximum** distance between any two
    points by removing exactly one point.

    **Constraints:**
    
      * `3 <= points.length <= 10 ^ 5`
      * `points[i].length == 2`
      * `1 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10 ^ 8`
