def stringIndices(wordsContainer: List[str], wordsQuery: List[str]) -> List[int]:
    """
    You are given two arrays of strings `wordsContainer` and `wordsQuery`.
    
    For each `wordsQuery[i]`, you need to find a string from `wordsContainer` that
    has the **longest common suffix** with `wordsQuery[i]`. If there are two or
    more strings in `wordsContainer` that share the longest common suffix, find
    the string that is the **smallest** in length. If there are two or more such
    strings that have the **same** smallest length, find the one that occurred
    **earlier** in `wordsContainer`.
    
    Return an array of integers `ans`, where `ans[i]` is the index of the
    string in `wordsContainer` that has the **longest common suffix** with
    `wordsQuery[i]`.

    **Constraints:**
    
      * `1 <= wordsContainer.length, wordsQuery.length <= 10 ^ 4`
      * `1 <= wordsContainer[i].length <= 5 * 10 ^ 3`
      * `1 <= wordsQuery[i].length <= 5 * 10 ^ 3`
      * `wordsContainer[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.
      * `wordsQuery[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.
      * Sum of `wordsContainer[i].length` is at most `5 * 10 ^ 5`.
      * Sum of `wordsQuery[i].length` is at most `5 * 10 ^ 5`.
