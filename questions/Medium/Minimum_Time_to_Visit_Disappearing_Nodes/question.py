def minimumTime(n: int, edges: List[List[int]], disappear: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    There is an undirected graph of `n` nodes. You are given a 2D array `edges`,
    where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, lengthi]` describes an edge between node `ui` and
    node `vi` with a traversal time of `lengthi` units.
    
    Additionally, you are given an array `disappear`, where `disappear[i]` denotes
    the time when the node `i` disappears from the graph and you won't be able to
    visit it.
    
    **Notice** that the graph might be disconnected and might contain multiple
    edges.
    
    Return the array `answer`, with `answer[i]` denoting the **minimum** units of
    time required to reach node `i` from node 0. If node `i` is **unreachable**
    from node 0 then `answer[i]` is `-1`.
    
    **Constraints:**
    
      * `1 <= n <= 5 * 10 ^ 4`
      * `0 <= edges.length <= 10 ^ 5`
      * `edges[i] == [ui, vi, lengthi]`
      * `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
      * `1 <= lengthi <= 10 ^ 5`
      * `disappear.length == n`
      * `1 <= disappear[i] <= 10 ^ 5`
