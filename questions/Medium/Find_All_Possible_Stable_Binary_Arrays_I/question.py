def numberOfStableArrays(zero: int, one: int, limit: int) -> int:
    """
    You are given 3 positive integers `zero`, `one`, and `limit`.
    A binary array `arr` is called **stable** if:
      * The number of occurrences of 0 in `arr` is **exactly**`zero`.
      * The number of occurrences of 1 in `arr` is **exactly** `one`.
      * Each subarray of `arr` with a size greater than `limit` must contain **both** 0 and 1.
    Return the total number of **stable** binary arrays.
    Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10 ^ 9 + 7`.
    **Constraints:**
      * `1 <= zero, one, limit <= 200`
