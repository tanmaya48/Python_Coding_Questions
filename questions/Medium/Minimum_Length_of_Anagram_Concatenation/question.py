def minAnagramLength(s: str) -> int:
    """
    You are given a string `s`, which is known to be a concatenation of
    **anagrams** of some string `t`.
    
    Return the **minimum** possible length of the string `t`.
    
    An **anagram** is formed by rearranging the letters of a string. For example,
    "aab", "aba", and, "baa" are anagrams of "aab".
    
    **Constraints:**
    
      * `1 <= s.length <= 10 ^ 5`
      * `s` consist only of lowercase English letters.
