    You are given an integer array `nums`.
    
    Return an integer that is the **maximum** distance between the **indices** of
    two (not necessarily different) prime numbers in `nums`.

      * `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 5`
      * `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
      * The input is generated such that the number of prime numbers in the `nums` is at least one.
