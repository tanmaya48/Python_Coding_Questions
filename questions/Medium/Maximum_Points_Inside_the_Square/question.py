def maxPointsInsideSquare(points: List[List[int]], s: str) -> int:
    """
    You are given a 2D**** array `points` and a string `s` where, `points[i]`
    represents the coordinates of point `i`, and `s[i]` represents the **tag** of
    point `i`.
    
    A **valid** square is a square centered at the origin `(0, 0)`, has edges
    parallel to the axes, and **does not** contain two points with the same tag.
    
    Return the **maximum** number of points contained in a **valid** square.
    
    Note:
    
      * A point is considered to be inside the square if it lies on or within the square's boundaries.
      * The side length of the square can be zero.    
    
    **Constraints:**
    
      * `1 <= s.length, points.length <= 10 ^ 5`
      * `points[i].length == 2`
      * `-10 ^ 9 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10 ^ 9`
      * `s.length == points.length`
      * `points` consists of distinct coordinates.
      * `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
