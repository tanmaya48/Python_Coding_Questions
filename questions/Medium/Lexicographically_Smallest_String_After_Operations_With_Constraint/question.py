def getSmallestString(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    """
    You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.
    
    Define a function `distance(s1, s2)` between two strings `s1` and `s2` of the
    same length `n` as:
    
      * The **sum** of the **minimum distance** between `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` when the characters from `'a'` to `'z'` are placed in a **cyclic** order, for all `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]`.
    
    For example, `distance("ab", "cd") == 4`, and `distance("a", "z") == 1`.
    
    You can **change** any letter of `s` to **any** other lowercase English
    letter, **any** number of times.
    
    Return a string denoting the **lexicographically smallest** string `t` you can
    get after some changes, such that `distance(s, t) <= k`.
    
    **Constraints:**
    
      * `1 <= s.length <= 100`
      * `0 <= k <= 2000`
      * `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
