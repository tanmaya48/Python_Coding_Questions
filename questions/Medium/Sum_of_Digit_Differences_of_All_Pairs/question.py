    You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers where all
    integers have the **same** number of digits.
    
    The **digit difference** between two integers is the count of different
    digits that are in the **same** position in the two integers.
    
    Return the **sum** of the **digit differences** between **all** pairs of
    integers in `nums`.

    **Constraints:**
    
      * `2 <= nums.length <= 10 ^ 5`
      * `1 <= nums[i] < 10 ^ 9`
      * All integers in `nums` have the same number of digits.
