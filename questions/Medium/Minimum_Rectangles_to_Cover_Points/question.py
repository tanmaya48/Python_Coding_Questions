def minRectanglesToCoverPoints(points: List[List[int]], w: int) -> int:
    """
    You are given a 2D integer array `points`, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`. You
    are also given an integer `w`. Your task is to **cover** **all** the given
    points with rectangles.
    
    Each rectangle has its lower end at some point `(x1, 0)` and its upper end at
    some point `(x2, y2)`, where `x1 <= x2`, `y2 >= 0`, and the condition `x2 - x1
    <= w` **must** be satisfied for each rectangle.
    
    A point is considered covered by a rectangle if it lies within or on the
    boundary of the rectangle.
    
    Return an integer denoting the **minimum** number of rectangles needed so that
    each point is covered by **at least one** rectangle.
    
    **Note:** A point may be covered by more than one rectangle.
    
    **Constraints:**
    
      * `1 <= points.length <= 10 ^ 5`
      * `points[i].length == 2`
      * `0 <= xi == points[i][0] <= 10 ^ 9`
      * `0 <= yi == points[i][1] <= 10 ^ 9`
      * `0 <= w <= 10 ^ 9`
      * All pairs `(xi, yi)` are distinct.
